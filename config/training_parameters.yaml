# Ultralytics YOLO ðŸš€, AGPL-3.0 license.
# Sonia-AI training settings.

# Main settings -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Do not change these parameters (or the model won't work and won't learn).
task: segment # (str) YOLO task, i.e. detect, segment, classify, pose.
mode: train # (str) YOLO mode, i.e. train, val, predict, export, track, benchmark.

# Train settings -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usually, 100 epochs is enough.
epochs: 100 # (int) number of epochs to train for.

# Warning it overides the number of epochs, useful is you have a known delay to train your model (at the competition).
time: # (float, optional) number of hours to train for, overrides epochs if supplied.

# Stop the training after this number of epochs without improvements.
patience: 20 # (int) epochs to wait for no observable improvement for early stopping of training.

# Take care not to overload the RAM memory of your computer.
batch: 16 # (int) number of images per batch (-1 for AutoBatch).

# 640 is good, 320 is faster but induces a loss of precision.
imgsz: 640 # (int | list) input images size as int for train and val modes, or list[w,h] for predict and export modes.

# If you want to train a model, don't set it as False.
save: True # (bool) save train checkpoints and predict results.

# Good idea to save each epoch is there is a risk that the training stops.
save_period: -1 # (int) Save checkpoint every x epochs (disabled if < 1).

# Really useful to see if the training went well or not.
plots: True # (bool) save plots and images during train/val.

# Auto is good.
optimizer: auto # (str) optimizer to use, choices=[SGD, Adam, Adamax, AdamW, NAdam, RAdam, RMSProp, auto].

# You should use 1.0 since the dataset is already divided in train, val and test sets.
fraction: 1.0 # (float) dataset fraction to train on (default is 1.0, all images in train set).

# Hyperparameters ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 0.0 corresponds to one-hot encoding.
label_smoothing: 0.0 # (float) label smoothing (fraction).
