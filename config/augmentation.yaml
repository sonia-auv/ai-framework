# Augmentation  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Useful for AUVs, helps with brightness or lighting changes.
hsv_h: 0.015 # (float) image HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction).
hsv_s: 0.7 # (float) image HSV-Saturation augmentation (fraction).
hsv_v: 0.4 # (float) image HSV-Value augmentation (fraction).

# Useful for AUVs, is can help because the AUV can slightly rotate.
degrees: 20 # (float) image rotation (+/- deg).

# Useful for AUVs, helps detecting object is at the edge.
translate: 0.2 # (float) image translation (+/- fraction).

# Useful for AUVs beauce objects size can change depending on their distance to the AUV.
scale: 0.2 # (float) image scale (+/- gain).

# Useful for AUVs, it help with changes of perspective. 
perspective: 0.001 # (float) image perspective (+/- fraction), range 0-0.001.

# Not useful for AUVs, because these transformations won't occur underwater.
shear: 0.0 # (float) image shear (+/- deg).

# Not really useful for AUVs, since they won't flip while detecting objects.
flipud: 0.0 # (float) image flip up-down (probability).
fliplr: 0.0 # (float) image flip left-right (probability).

# No idea whether these transformation improves learning or not, we need to test it.
mosaic: 0.0 # (float) image mosaic (probability).
close_mosaic: 10 # (int) disable mosaic augmentation for final epochs (0 to disable).

# No idea whether these transformation improves learning or not, we need to test it.
mixup: 0.0 # (float) image mixup (probability).

# No idea whether these transformation improves learning or not, we need to test it.
copy_paste: 0.0 # (float) segment copy-paste (probability).

# No idea whether these transformation improves learning or not, we need to test it.
auto_augment: None # (str) auto augmentation policy for classification (randaugment, autoaugment, augmix).

# No idea whether these transformation improves learning or not, we need to test it.
erasing: 0.0 # (float) probability of random erasing during classification training (0-1).

# No idea whether these transformation improves learning or not, we need to test it.
crop_fraction: 0.0 # (float) image crop fraction for classification evaluation/inference (0-1).
